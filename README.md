In the industry, I'm often amusingly dubbed as a 'unicorn'. The first eight years of my career was spent in graphic design. My work spread across a large range of mediums from print, editorial, advertising through to digital UI and UX. I decided to switch to a career in front-end web development around four years ago, because I love building interactive design features and constantly learning new skills. I like to work with passionate teams, problem solving to reach a common goal. For a more detailed look at my skill-set, see below:

HTML / XML
CSS, SASS, Bootstrap
JavaScript and API's
Some React.js/ Vue.js
CMS based PHP
NPM / Webpack / GIT
Jira / clickup
